        Sorry for calling you a moron. But I am the website builder of MineBoxMC. (btw the server address this MineBoxxMC.minehut.gg) Just 4 hours ago I learned how to HTML and CSS code. So I am remaking the website so it is better than ever before! But for now I have to code it :( Have a good time playing MineBoxMC!
